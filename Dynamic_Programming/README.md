### Dynamic Programming

To overcome the problem in the backtracking , we came to use the Dynamic programming . where time complexity of backtracking takes O(2^n)

DP - Two approaches

#### Memoization

- Top Down approach
- Recursive approach

#### Tabulation

- Down Top approach
- Iterative approach

## Use Tabulation method

Step 1 : Visualize the end state table
